# 865datamining

This is the project of CPSC 8650 data mining. The project is implementation of SH algorithm.


Right now: Change LSH from RNN to KNN. Finish compare script. Generated dataset from mnist.

Furture work: Change the main function in LSHmain.cpp. Generate H-R radius search in LSH, then query each points to find the r', which r'-NN > const * K. Then insert all points with their r'. Change the query part in LSHmain.cpp a little to adjust the new data structure.
